These are a couple of projects of me learning Python/Django while on Vacation.

I would not recommend anyone following the patterns as I do not think they meet 
best practices/standards - I was mainly just getting things to work.

I am also probably committing files I shouldn't and some commits are bulky.

But all in all - I learned Django! Which is the important thing :D
